## 0.0.1

- Initial release and project structure.
- Reserving the `stl` package name.

## 0.1.0

### Added
- Introduced the core `Vector<T>` class.
- Overloaded `operator ==` and `hashCode` for deep value-based equality matching instead of default reference equality.
- Implemented C++ STL-style lexicographical comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) and `compareTo` by enforcing `T extends Comparable`.
- Re-added random element access (`operator []` and `operator []=`) with strict memory safety and bounds checking.
- Overridden `toString()` for beautifully formatted array-like console output.
- Implemented core container modifiers (`push_back`, `pop_back`, `clear`, `insert`) with underlying bounds validation.

### Changed
- Completely rewrote `Vector<T>` to establish a clean slate and focus on strict `const` and `final` list initialization semantics.
- Temporarily removed all extended operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `at()`, `toList()`, etc.) for architectural redesign.
